# MenardsRebate
Python dialog that gathers rebate user information and stores it for filling out Menards rebates.
The first time this is used, the application will load a User Configuration dialog.
The application supports multiple users, which is handy for example, when the user has a business that might have different address and email than the personal information.
After the user information is stored, the application will accept rebate numbers, retreive the rebate form and fill it out from the user data.

This application was developed as a learning experience and as such, there are many places the code could be factored or improved. Feel free, but please comment with pedagogical information.
